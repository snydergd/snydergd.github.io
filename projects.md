Here are some goofy little experiments I've added links to here.

- Fidget/vibration test page: [gFidget](/gfidget/)
- [Github pages test HTML page](test.html)
- [COBOL report header generator](cobolreport)
- [Bat signal controller](batman) - Fun little quick and dirty project to make a web-controllable wifi-connected bat signal device practicing FreeCAD and PlatformIO - weekend project and works - will maybe put up some files for it at some point if someone thinks it would be fun to make.
