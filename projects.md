Some small coding/learning projects that I have here include:

- Fidget/vibration test page: [gFidget](/gfidget/)
- [COBOL report header generator](cobolreport)
- [Beginning of a code learning tool/game for kids](/code-learn/)
- [Bat signal controller](batman) - Fun little quick and dirty project to make a web-controllable wifi-connected bat signal device practicing FreeCAD and PlatformIO - weekend project and works - will maybe put up some files for it at some point if someone thinks it would be fun to make.
- My [todo.txt quick reference visual](todo.txt_summary.png) -- not really a project, but pretty honored that they liked it enough to keep it in the todo.txt documentation.
- A [QR Code display page](go.html), which can be used to quickly create a QR code for a page by pasting a short URL in front of an existing URL.
