## Local testing
First install [bundler](https://bundler.io/) (example: `gem install bundler`).  This is a global thing and the rest will be local to this directory.

```bash
bundle install
bundle exec jekyll serve
```

Then open [localhost:4000](http://localhost:4000)

## Deploying to GitHub Pages
