title: "My 12 weeks off"

excerpt: Personal takeaways from my parent leave
---

#### Reason for this post
I love to hear other people's thoughts/insights on life, and feel like there should be more, so want
to contribute my own.

#### Background
We had a 3rd kid in May of this year, and after some thought I decided to **use all the time off** my
employer offered to me for this, which was 4 weeks of paid leave for the child after exhausting
my sick time, which ended up being about 12 weeks off total.

Part of me felt wrong for doing this, but at the same time, it's my 3rd child and how often do you get
to spend that much time with your kids while they are young?  It doesn't happen very often and when it
comes down to it, my family is a more important part of my life than my work (though sometimes it's easy
to lose sight of that being at work all day).

Anyway, I wanted to **reflect on what this has been like!**

#### Objective 1: Stepping back on work
The best part of vacation in terms of work, I think, is having time and openness to ask yourself "is this work worth
doing?"  While no doubt my job has a purpose and has huge potential for value, it's easy to get
stuck with work that doesn't effectively do what my position is made for.  For example, I might
know something about a topic and get pulled into conversations on that topic, but it's not a specific
requirement of my role.  This can be bad because:

- I can have a bigger impact doing something else
- The people I'm helping can become weaker by relying on me

It's easy for me to just do what I'm asked and not complain or think anything of it, but these collect
like garbage in my work schedule, and clog up my pipeline for effectively completing the work I'm
most effective at.

I think this will happen naturally since I'm already starting to disconnect from many of the old
trivial topics my schedule was plagued with.

Playing Chess during the break has actually been providing some interesting perspectives on this topic.
The extra work is similar to attacks from an opponent.  Here are a few examples:

1. Sometimes in Chess you'll be afraid of an attack on your pieces that you feel you need to deal
with immediately.  However, you might want to calculate how many moves your own attack would take
to complete compared to the opponents.  It might be that you can simply ignore their attack
and complete yours.  You might suffer some loss in the meantime, but it won't matter in the end.
2. Sometimes in chess you are tempted to take a piece offerred for exchange.  While it's tempting
to get that piece out of the way so you have more room to move, having their piece in the way can
actually be helpful in keeping the oponent from invading through that way.
3. You can't simply anticipate and react to opponent's moves.  You need to have an idea of things
to achieve and paths to get there, and make progress toward them even in the face of oncoming
attacks.

#### Objective 2: Really stepping back on life
Stepping back farther, I ask "am I accomplishing with my life what I want to accomplish?"

This leads to a more basic question: "what do I want to do accomplish with my life?" (what is fulfilling)
And harder (existential) is why do I want to accomplish this?

For the **why** -- No one knows for sure what is beyond death - the logical explanation is that there is
nothing beyond it - that we just cease to exist like we didn't exist before we were born.  There is [Pascal's 
Wager](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pascal%27s_wager) which poses the idea that it's a gamble to believe this.
Beyond this, one may ignore the gamble and voluntarily take a belief in a God and life after death for other
reasons.

No matter your belief, I believe that **love/devotion** for others is the key to a fullfilling life:

1. Giving to others gives you a sense of happiness that doesn't go away easily and definitely doesn't reverse
itself.  In contrast, pleasure in things/experiences quickly fades and can even cause negative emotions as the
effects of the object fade and disappoint the subject.
2. By shifting focus from your own wellbeing, you become more resilliant to hardships in your life.  The Bible
actually has a nice description of this effect:

    >But let patience have her perfect work, that ye may be perfect and entire, wanting nothing. - James 1:4-8

3. If you believe in a deity and religion, then love/devotion to that deity will usually bring you rewards after
death.

"Others" could be projects, like open source software.  There's a lot of room for failure/disappointment here,
though, I think, and so I think it's better to focus on the people you are helping, or your deity (even better
in my mind, because there is even less no room for disappointment there).

So **what** should I accomplish with my life then?  I think with main driver of having love and devotion
for others, there won't necessarily be major accomplishments to look back on, but instead someone could look back
on the ways they have helped people, and the joy that came from helping them, whether people directly, or
the deity you believe in.  There could no doubt be larger goals which have helped others, such as open source
software, but the focus should be on the people and not the project.  So in my case, I should ask myself
instead "do I love and devote myself to others and God enough?"  I often find myself looking for joy in
accomplishments and things.

So I think the answer to the main question is **NO** - I am not accomplishing what I want to accomplish with
my life.  The next task for me will be to find a path forward.  I think that maybe it's like successful
diet plans, where you take small steps that work for you and make a lifestyle change vs. trying to use
someone else's choices yourself.

#### Other things noticed

1. There aren't many places to find people to be friends with - it's important to keep your connections!
2. Loving your larger work/projects/tasks makes it hard to give other things appropriate priority because
usually you can work on them for long periods of time and don't get much reward until the end.  Be careful
about letting yourself dive into something new.
